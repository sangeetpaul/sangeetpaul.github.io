							<p>I grew up with multiple languages; I spoke Odia, Hindi, Bangla, and English, and fortunately had access to hearing multiple dialects of each. At some point in my childhood, I started noticing similarities in them. That made the differences stand out even more starkly. When I eventually had access to the internet, I started looking for why languages are the way they are. The story of the Indo-European family of languages spreading out across so much of the known world fascinated me, and the similarities finally began to make sense. The mystery surrounding the Indus Valley Civilization's language was a reminder of what we had lost to history. If I wasn't a physicist, I think I would've been a linguist.</p>
							<p>There was another language I grew up around, the one spoken by most of my family amongst each other, but I had never really mentally registered it as a full-fledged language. The general understanding was that it was a frontier tongue, either a dialect of one of the more "civilizationally important" languages around us like Bangla or Odia, or a creole of them all. The grammar and technical vocabulary is not different from east Indian languages, which share those aspects; not surprising knowing they all descend from the same parent: Māgadhī Prākrit. But its core vocabulary was different enough from nearby languages, maybe as different as Odia and Bangla are from each other. The extensive documentation on other languages made me wonder whether something similar should exist for what is evidently my native language, which I now call Gahaḷā, literally the crowd's language. I came to know later that an old relative of mine had attempted to compile a dictionary of sorts decades ago, but that is now lost. So I decided to try my hand at documenting the language myself. You can take a look at it <a href="https://sangeetpaul.notion.site/gahala">here</a>.</p>
